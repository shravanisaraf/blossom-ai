# BlossomAI üå∏
A **flower classification web app** that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to identify flower species from images. This project combines deep learning with a simple web interface built using Flask, allowing users to upload flower images and receive real-time predictions.

## Project Overview
BlossomAI is designed to:
- Predict the species of flowers from images using a pre-trained CNN model (VGG16).
- Provide an intuitive web interface for users to upload their own flower photos.
- Display predictions along with the model‚Äôs confidence scores.

This project is part of a machine learning portfolio to showcase deep learning skills and model deployment in a web application.

## Features
- üåº **Upload Flower Images**: Users can upload flower images to the web app for classification.
- üåª **Supports 102 Flower Categories**: The model is trained on the **102 Category Flower Dataset** from Oxford University.
- üå∏ **Interactive UI**: A simple, user-friendly interface built with HTML/CSS and Flask.
- üå∫ **Real-time Predictions**: Get instant feedback on the predicted flower species after image upload.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, Keras (VGG16 model for transfer learning)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Plotly (for optional data insights)
- **Deployment**: Heroku (or your chosen platform)

## How to Run the Project Locally

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BlossomAI.git
cd BlossomAI
```
### 2. Install Dependencies
Install all necessary dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 3. Add the Pre-trained Model
Download the pre-trained VGG16 model (or the `model.h5` file) and place it inside the `model/` directory. If you don't have a model file, you can train your own using the code provided.

### 4. Run the App
Start the Flask app by running:

```bash
python app.py
```

## Model Training
The model was trained on the **102 Category Flower Dataset** using the following steps:

- **Model Architecture**: Used the pre-trained VGG16 model for feature extraction.
- **Custom Layers**: Added custom dense layers to classify 102 flower species.
- **Data Augmentation**: Applied augmentation techniques (rotation, zooming, flipping) to increase dataset variability.
- **Training**: Trained the model for 25-30 epochs with early stopping to avoid overfitting.

You can retrain the model by using the same dataset and following the steps in `train_model.py`.
